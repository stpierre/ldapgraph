v1.0.0, 3-Mar-2008

  configurability

* Supports Fedora DS 1.1, with FHS paths
* New, more detailed graph layout
* Sysconfig file added to make it easier to reconfigure and update
  with RPM
* FDSGraph will now attempt to determine its instance rather than
  relying on the hostname of the machine.  If one instance exists, it

  require you to use the -I (instance) flag
* Deprecated the -l (logfile) flag in favor of -I
* Fixed a bug that would prevent the connections graph from getting
