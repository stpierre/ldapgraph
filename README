LDAPGraph is a graphing tool for various LDAP servers.  It is known
to work with 389 Directory Server (formerly Fedora DS), and should
also work with Red Hat DS and Sun DS as well.  OpenLDAP support is
forthcoming.

Given the forthcoming OpenLDAP support, LDAPGraph is in the process of
a) changing name from 389-ds-graph to LDAPGraph; and b) moving from
Sourceforge to Github.  Please pardon our mess.

Ideally, after installing, you should just have to run:

# service ldapgraph start
# service httpd graceful

The web interface can be found at

LDAPGraph assumes by default that you have an 389 DS instance named
after the shortname of your server (i.e., config files for your
instance are in /etc/dirsrv/slapd-$(hostname -s)).  If this isn't the
case, change the value of INSTANCE in /etc/sysconfig/ldapgraph.

LDAP Graph does not currently support graphing data from more
than one 389 DS instance, nor from
