---------- UPGRADING FROM FDSGRAPH v0.2 ----------

Copy the files for v0.3 to the following places:

/usr/local/bin/fdsgraph.pl
/var/www/cgi-bin/fdsgraph.cgi
/etc/init.d/fdsgraph

(This is for RHEL4; the location of fdsgraph.cgi may change on other
platforms and/or depending on your Apache configuration.)

Check ownership of all files.  They should be owned by root;
fdsgraph.cgi should be set to the 'apache' group, and the others to
'root'.  fdsgraph and fdsgraph.cgi should both be 755, fdsgraph.pl
should be 750.

Restart FDSgraph:

# /etc/init.d/fdsgraph restart

---------- UPGRADING FROM FDSGRAPH v0.1 ----------
