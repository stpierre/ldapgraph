FDSGRAPH -- A Fedora DS log grapher

Based on mailgraph by David Schweikert

Before installing fdsgraph, you must install rrdtool and the Perl RRDs
library.  On a RHEL system, that corresponds to the 'rrdtool' and
'perl-rrdtool' RPMs.

To install fdsgraph, copy the files to the following places:

/usr/local/bin/fdsgraph.pl
/var/www/cgi-bin/fdsgraph.cgi
/etc/init.d/fdsgraph

(This is for RHEL4; the location of fdsgraph.cgi may change on other
platforms and/or depending on your Apache configuration.)

All of the files should be owned by root; fdsgraph.cgi should be set
to the 'apache' group, and the others to 'root'.  fdsgraph and
fdsgraph.cgi should both be 755, fdsgraph.pl should be 750.

Next, run:

# chkconfig --add fdsgraph
# service fdsgraph start

This will start fdsgraph and get it cruching through your current
'access' log.  You'll be able to access the graphs at
http://your-ldap-server.example.com/cgi-bin/fdsgraph.cgi
