FDSGRAPH -- A Fedora DS log grapher

Based on mailgraph by David Schweikert

Before installing fdsgraph, you must install rrdtool and the Perl RRDs
library.  On a RHEL system, that corresponds to the 'rrdtool' and
'perl-rrdtool' RPMs.

To install fdsgraph, copy the files to the following places:

/usr/local/bin/fdsgraph.pl
/var/www/cgi-bin/fdsgraph.cgi
/etc/init.d/fdsgraph
fdsgraph-sysconfig => /etc/sysconfig/fdsgraph

(This is for RHEL 4 and 5; the location of fdsgraph.cgi may change on other
platforms and/or depending on your Apache configuration.)

All of the files should be owned by root; fdsgraph.cgi should be set
to the 'apache' group, and the others to 'root'.  The fdsgraph init
script, sysconfig file, and fdsgraph.cgi should all be 755,
fdsgraph.pl should be 750.

Next, run:

# chkconfig --add fdsgraph
# service fdsgraph start

This will start fdsgraph and get it cruching through your current
'access' log.  You'll be able to access the graphs at
http://your-ldap-server.example.com/cgi-bin/fdsgraph.cgi
