v1.0.1, 10-Mar-2008

* Fixed bug that prevented SSL connections from being counted properly
  (Thanks to Andrey Ivanov!)

v1.0, 3-Mar-2008

* Renamed to Fedora DS Graph
* Fedora DS Graph now places CGIs in /usr/share, to adhere to FHS
* Instance detection done in sysconfig file, to increase
  configurability
* Renamed files to ds-* or fedora-ds-*
* Fixed a number of small bugs

v0.3, 28-Feb-2008

* Supports Fedora DS 1.1, with FHS paths
* New, more detailed graph layout
* Sysconfig file added to make it easier to reconfigure and update
  with RPM
* FDSGraph will now attempt to determine its instance rather than
  relying on the hostname of the machine.  If one instance exists, it
  will use that by default; if more than one instance exists, it will
  require you to use the -I (instance) flag
* Deprecated the -l (logfile) flag in favor of -I
* Fixed a bug that would prevent the connections graph from getting
  updated at all if there were no connections for a while.  It should
  get updated with zeros
* Fixed warnings from log entries on FDS startup

v0.2, 21-Dec-2006

* Added support for TLS connections to the connection graph
